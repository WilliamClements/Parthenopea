# Parthenopea video
This is an outline for a talk/video I am making to tout my Haskell project.

For more on music educational software and Euterpea, see https://www.euterpea.com/ and obtain its textbook ***Haskell School of Music***. 

## Sections I and II
The first section delves into *PCommand*, the executable with no UI. How to start using it from scratch as if I just **gave** you the executable (building it from github etc. is the hard part).

The srcond section concerns the underlying technology, including:
1. developing a song - interface is Euterpea itself, plus additional functions like *passage* to program dynamics. Doing a *passage* is strongly analogous to placing PP or FF, or crescendo/diminuendo markings into a music score.
2. liimitations around producing music in this fashion.
